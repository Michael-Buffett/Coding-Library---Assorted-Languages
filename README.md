# Coding-Library-Assorted-Languages
As a newb, I wanted to document some of the code I've been learning/found useful along the way. This repository will be a living, breathing document, but I hope to create something worthwhile as times go on. For now, if you have somehow stumbled upon this by mistake, I apologize.
